## 🌐 My Mindset

I'm a generalist at heart, always on the lookout for something that truly excites me. Whether it's frontend development, 3D modeling, or data science, I love exploring diverse areas until something clicks. Right now, I’m experimenting with different technologies and hoping to specialize in the one that captivates me the most.
